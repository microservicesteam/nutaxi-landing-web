# nutaxi-landing-web
Landing page for nutaxi web application.

### Function
This is where the "nutaxi.com" will land you. Its connected to the routeservice and orchestrates connection between various ui bits.

### Support
As part of the learning process right now I will copy many bits and pieces from various angular 2 seeds and examples so the code right now is full of pollyfills which makes it slower but support all kind of browser. I wish to granularly remove these and support browsers conforming ES6 only. I don't wish to support IE/Edge in any form, version or function.
Target Browser -> Latest Chrome
